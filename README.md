# CLRLisp
A Lisp tailored for the CLR.

The idea here is to leverage as much as we can from the Common
Language Runtime in order to see what sort of Lisp naturally evolves.
We are not trying to be compatible with anything or to meet any
standards.  We are deliberately trying not to design or engineer
anything we don't have to in order to make a minimal viable Lisp.
